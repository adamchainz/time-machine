* Optimize patching of ``uuid`` module.
  By avoiding using ``unittest.mock``, this small overhead from starting ``time_machine.travel()`` has been reduced about 20x, from ~600ns to ~30ns by one benchmark.

  `PR #585 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/585>`__.

3.0.0 (2025-11-18)
------------------

* Remove mocking of ``time.monotonic()`` and ``time.monotonic_ns()``.

  This mocking caused too many issues, such as causing freezes in asyncio event loops (`Issue #387 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/387>`__), preventing pytest-durations from timing tests correctly (`Issue #505 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/505>`__), and triggering timeouts in psycopg (`Issue #509 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/509>`__).
  The root cause here is that mocking the monotonic clock breaks its contract, allowing it to move backwards when it’s meant to only move forwards.

  As an alternative, use |unittest.mock|__ to mock the monotonic function for the specific tested modules that need it.
  That means that your code should import ``monotonic()`` or ``monotonic_ns()`` directly, so that your tests can mock it in those places only.
  For example, if your system under test looks like:

  .. |unittest.mock| replace:: ``unittest.mock``
  __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html

  .. code-block:: python

      # example.py
      from time import monotonic


      def measurement():
          start = monotonic()
          ...
          end = monotonic()
          return end - start

  …then your tests can mock ``monotonic()`` like this:

  .. code-block:: python

      from unittest import TestCase, mock

      import example


      class MeasurementTests(TestCase):
          def test_success(self):
              with mock.patch.object(example, "monotonic", side_effect=[0.0, 1.23]):
                  result = example.measurement()
              assert result == 1.23

  `PR #560 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/560>`__.

* Parse ``str`` destinations with |datetime.fromisoformat()|__ first, before falling back to dateutil if installed.
  ``datetime.fromisoformat()`` can parse most valid ISO 8601 formats, with better performance and no extra dependencies.

  .. |datetime.fromisoformat()| replace:: ``datetime.fromisoformat()``
  __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat

  `PR #578 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/578>`__.

* Make the dependency on `dateutil <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ optional.
  To include dateutil support, install with the ``dateutil`` extra:

  .. code-block:: sh

      python -m pip install time-machine[dateutil]

  Beware that some of the formats that dateutil parses are ambiguous and may lead to unexpected results.

  `PR #576 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/576>`__.

* Rename the ``Coordinates`` class to ``Traveller``, to match the recommended context manager variable name.

  Thanks to Matt Wang in `PR #535 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/535>`__.

* Drop Python 3.9 support.

* Make the ``escape_hatch`` functions raise ``ValueError`` when called outside of time-travelling, rather than triggering segmentation faults.

  `PR #580 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/580>`__.

2.19.0 (2025-08-19)
-------------------

* Add marker support to :doc:`the pytest plugin <pytest_plugin>`.
  Decorate tests with ``@pytest.mark.time_machine(<destination>)`` to set time during a test, affecting function-level fixtures as well.

  Thanks to Javier Buzzi in `PR #499 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/499>`__.

* Add asynchronous context manager support to ``time_machine.travel()``.
  You can now use ``async with time_machine.travel(...):`` in asynchronous code, per :ref:`the documentation <travel-context-manager>`.

  `PR #556 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/556>`__.

* Import date and time functions once in the C extension.

  This should improve speed a little bit, and avoid segmentation faults when the functions have been swapped out, such as when freezegun is in effect.
  (time-machine still won’t apply if freezegun is in effect.)

  `PR #555 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/555>`__.

2.18.0 (2025-08-18)
-------------------

* Update the :ref:`migration CLI <migration-cli>` to detect unittest classes based on whether they use ``self.assert*`` methods like ``self.assertEqual()``.

  Thanks to Javier Buzzi in `PR #531 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/531>`__.

* Add support to ``travel()`` for ``datetime`` destinations with ``tzinfo`` set to ``datetime.UTC`` (``datetime.timezone.utc``).

  Thanks to Lawrence Law in `PR #502 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/502>`__.

* Prevent segmentation faults in unlikely scenarios, such as if the ``time_machine`` module cannot be imported.

  `PR #543 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/543>`__, `PR #545 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/545>`__.

* Make ``travel()`` fully unpatch date and time functions when travel ends. This may fix certain edge cases.

  `Issue #532 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/532>`__.

2.17.0 (2025-08-05)
-------------------

2.3.0 (2021-07-05)
------------------

* Allow passing ``tick`` to ``Coordinates.move_to()`` and the pytest fixture’s
  ``time_machine.move_to()``. This allows freezing or unfreezing of time when
  travelling.

2.2.0 (2021-07-02)
------------------

* Include type hints.

* Convert C module to use PEP 489 multi-phase extension module initialization.
  This makes the module ready for Python sub-interpreters.

  Apple Silicon.

* Stop distributing tests to reduce package size. Tests are not intended to be
  run outside of the tox setup in the repository. Repackagers can use GitHub's
  tarballs per tag.

2.1.0 (2021-02-19)
------------------

* Release now includes wheels for ARM on Linux.

2.0.1 (2021-01-18)
------------------

2.0.0 (2021-01-17)
------------------

* Release now includes wheels for Windows and macOS.
* Move internal calculations to use nanoseconds, avoiding a loss of precision.
* After a call to ``move_to()``, the first function call to retrieve the
  current time will return exactly the destination time, copying the behaviour
  of the first call to ``travel()``.
* Add the ability to shift timezone by passing in a ``ZoneInfo`` timezone.
* Remove ``tz_offset`` argument. This was incorrectly copied from
  ``freezegun``. Use the new timezone mocking with ``ZoneInfo`` instead.
* Add pytest plugin and fixture ``time_machine``.
* Work with Windows’ different epoch.

  travelling.

  Thanks to Søren Pilgård and Bart Van Loon for the report in
  `Issue #52 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/issues/52>`__.

1.2.0 (2020-07-08)
------------------

* Add ``move_to()`` method to move to a different time whilst travelling.
  This is based on freezegun's ``move_to()`` method.

1.1.1 (2020-06-22)
------------------

* Move C-level ``clock_gettime()`` and ``clock_gettime_ns()`` checks to
  runtime to allow distribution of macOS wheels.

1.1.0 (2020-06-08)
------------------

* Add ``shift()`` method to move forward in time by a delta whilst travelling.
  This is based on freezegun's ``tick()`` method.

  Thanks to Alex Subbotin for the feature in
  `PR #27 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/27>`__.

* Fix to work when either ``clock_gettime()`` or ``CLOCK_REALTIME`` is not
  present. This happens on some Unix platforms, for example on macOS with the
  official Python.org installer, which is compiled against macOS 10.9.

  Thanks to Daniel Crowe for the fix in
  `PR #30 <https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/pull/30>`__.
