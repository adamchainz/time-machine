Requirements
------------

Python 3.9 to 3.14 supported, including free-threaded variants from Python 3.13 onwards.

Only CPython is supported at this time because time-machine directly hooks into the C-level API.

Installation
------------

Use **pip**:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m pip install time-machine
